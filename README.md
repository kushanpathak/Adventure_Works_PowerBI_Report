🚲 AdventureWorks – Power BI Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a Microsoft Power BI business intelligence dashboard for AdventureWorks, a fictional global manufacturing company specializing in cycling equipment and accessories.

The dataset was supplied with the Maven Analytics Power BI Desktop course and is derived from Microsoft’s AdventureWorks sample databases.

The dataset covers 6 countries across 3 continents (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States) with sales and return data between 01/01/2020 and 30/06/2022. Customer profiles include demographics such as date of birth, income, education, occupation, and homeowner status.

📈 Insights

$24.9M revenue and $10.5M profit were generated between Jan 2020 – Jun 2022.

A noticeable dip in revenue occurred between Jun–Nov 2020, likely simulating the impact of COVID-19, followed by steady growth.

December 2021 was exceptional, generating $1.64M revenue, potentially due to a seasonal campaign (e.g., Black Friday).

Tires and tubes were the most ordered products, while cycling shorts had the highest return rate.

Sports helmets were among the top revenue-generating products, despite high return rates.

The most profitable product categories were clothing and accessories.

A significant step change occurred in weekly customers from Aug 2021, but revenue per customer declined year-on-year.

United States led with 8,700 orders and $7.94M revenue, while Australia had the highest revenue per customer ($2,131).
